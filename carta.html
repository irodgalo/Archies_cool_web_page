        This website is written as if it was written by my cat but in reality I created it as my first project to learn how to use CSS, HTML and a little bit of JavaScript tools, I also took the opportunity to include illustrations that I have created myself, the link to my Instagram where I upload illustrations, my LinkedIn and Github. There is also a section with links to different organizations that help cats, they are reliable and it would be very nice to support them. There are also several pictures of my cat, he is very cute. The page is made to open on a computer, I think it adapts well to any relatively large window size, I think it's a good first step but I hope soon to make a 100% responsive page. If you have come this far thank you very much for visiting my page and I hope you liked it, I had a lot of fun making it. Love, Iris.
