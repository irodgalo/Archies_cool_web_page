# Archies_cool_web_page 😻
This has been my first free web page completely made in CSS and HTML and a bit of JavaScript. Besides this this page has been completely illustrated by me. You can enter it through the following link:https://archies-cool-web-page.netlify.app/

It consists of a main page and three additional pages. Photos of the three additional pages are attached at the end of this text.

😼 The main page is composed of three sections. The header where you have the logo of the page and three icons that take us to my Github, my LinkedIn and my instagram page of illustrations:
